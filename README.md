# ExpLaineR1

## About :question:
**elr1** is a tool that aims at provide a decent explanation of the construction of an ELR(1) parser. Various tools exist that deal with LR(1) parsers: this project will deal with the extended version, namely allowing regular expressions in defining the right hand side of a grammar rule.

**PRE-ALPHA WARNING**
This is an hobby project, still in a very, very early stage of development. Feel free to look around, and provide feedback and/or help if you can, but remember that nothing of this is complete, and that it will likely change.

## Why? :robot:
This project was inspired by the Formal languages and compilers course taught at Politecnico di Milano, Italy. I found the ELR(1) parsing method interesting, and I noted the lack of an automated tool that could help us students in practicing. This project is **not affiliated**, or by any mean **related** to the university.

## Language :wrench:
This project is developed using three primary technologies: the C++ language, the pair flex/bison, and CMake. I'm not really an expert in none of these (except having an intermediate experience with flex/bison), and this project is also meant to be an exercise to lear them. Therefore, the code you'll se will likely not make use of best practices, and contain code smell. Please, let me know of any possible improvement you spot! I'll greatly appreciate that.

## License :bison:
This project is released under the terms of GNU General Public License, version 3 or any later version. I choose that because I found it to be the most accademic-y license for an educational project. However, I'd like to point out that, in my opinion, technological progress must be paired with technology ethics. In that sense, I agree that "[software shall be used for good, not evil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Crockford#%22Good,_not_Evil%22)". So, I'd like to accept [the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/about/acm-code-of-ethics-booklet.pdf).
